\section{Positrons and Positronium}
Positrons (denoted by $e^+$) are the antiparticle equivalent to electrons.  The mass and spin are same as that of electrons, but the charge is $+1e$, compared to the charge of $-1e$ on an electron. Paul Dirac first theorized the positron (antielectron) in 1931 \cite{Dirac1931}, and it was discovered shortly thereafter by Carl D. Anderson in 1932 \cite{Anderson1933}.

Stjepan Mohorovi\u{c}i\'{c} theorized the existence of positronium (Ps) in 1934 \cite{Mohorovicic1934}, but it was not created until 1951 by Martin Deutsch \cite{Deutsch1951}. Ps is an exotic atom consisting of a positron and an electron.  This atom is similar in some ways to hydrogen but also differs in some key aspects. Namely that Ps annihilates, emitting two or three $\gamma$ rays, depending on the spin \cite{Charlton2001}. In the singlet state, also known as parapositronium, the lifetime is $\SI{125}{\ps}$ \cite{Czarnecki1999}. The triplet, or orthopositronium, lasts approximately 1000 times longer with a lifetime of $\SI{142}{\ns}$ \cite{Vallery2003}. Due to the the short lifetime of parapositronium, the majority of experimental data of Ps-atom and Ps-molecule scattering comes from orthopositronium.

\subsection{Positronium and Hydrogen Wavefunctions}
The reduced mass for hydrogen is
\begin{equation}
\mu_H = \frac{m_p m_e}{m_p + m_e}.
\end{equation}

In the limit where the proton has infinite mass, the reduced mass becomes
\begin{equation}
%\lim_{m_p \to \infty} \frac{m_p + m_e}{m_p m_e} = \frac{1}{m_e} = \mu_H^{-1}
\lim_{m_p \to \infty} \frac{m_p m_e}{m_p + m_e} = m_e \approx \mu_H.
\end{equation}

The positronium system is similar to the hydrogen atom with the proton replaced by a positron, meaning we can no longer use the infinite mass approximation, as $m_{e^+} = m_e$.
\begin{equation}
\mu_{Ps} = \frac{m_e^2}{2 m_e} = \frac{m_e}{2}.
\end{equation}

To obtain the Ps wavefunction, we can start with the wavefunction for H and replace $m_e \rightarrow \frac{m_e}{2}$.  The ground state wavefunction for H is
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{100,H} = \left(\frac{1}{\pi a_0^3}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \!\! \ee^{-\frac{r}{a_0}},
\text{where } a_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e \,e^2} \;.
\end{equation}
The $100$ represents the $n \ell m$ quantum numbers, and we are only considering ground state H and Ps. 
If we denote $a_0 \rightarrow a_0'$, where we replace $m_e$ by $m_e/2$ $\frac{m_e}{2}$, the positronium ground state wavefunction can be writen easily as
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{100,Ps} = \left(\frac{1}{\pi {a_0'}^3}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \!\! \ee^{-\frac{r}{a_0'}},
\text{where } a_0' = \frac{2\hbar^2}{m_e \,e^2} \;.
\end{equation}
Working in atomic units (see \cref{sec:Units}), $a_0 = 1$ (i.e. $\hbar = m_e = e = 1$), giving
\begin{equation}
\Phi_H\left(r_3\right) \equiv \Phi_{100,H}\left(r_3\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \ee^{-r_3}
\label{eq:HWave}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{Ps}\left(r_{12}\right) \equiv \Phi_{100,Ps}\left(r_{12}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{8 \pi}} \ee^{-r_{12}/2} \;.
\label{eq:PsWave}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Positronium and Hydrogen Energies}

When the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solved for the hydrogen atom, the energy is seen to be (neglecting higher-order effects)
\beq
\label{eq:HEnergy}
E_{n,H} = -\frac{R_\infty}{n^2}.
\eeq
In Hartree atomic units, $R_\infty = \frac{1}{2}$, giving
\beq
\label{eq:HEnergyAU}
E_{n,H} = -\frac{1}{2 n^2}.
\eeq
Due to the reduced mass of half that of hydrogen, the energy of positronium is
\beq
\label{eq:PsEnergyAU}
E_{n,Ps} = -\frac{1}{4 n^2}.
\eeq

For a given level $n$, the energy of positronium is half that of hydrogen. The ionization energy is approximately $\SI{-6.8}{\eV}$, versus that of $\SI{-13.6}{\eV}$ for hydrogen. Figure \ref{fig:HPsLevels} compares the energy levels of positronium and hydrogen.

\section{Positronium Hydride}
\label{sec:PsH}
Positronium hydride (PsH) is a molecule \todo{Not exactly true} comprised of a hydrogen atom and a positronium atom. After Wheeler \cite{Wheeler1946} showed that positrons could be part of what he called a polyelectronic compound, Ore shortly thereafter predicted PsH in 1951 \cite{Ore1951}. PsH was not experimentally verified until 1992 by Schrader \cite{Schrader1992}.
