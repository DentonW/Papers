@article{O'Malley1962a,
abstract = {In the scattering of a particle (or system) of charge Ze by a neutral system with an electrical polarizability $\alpha$, an electric dipole moment is induced which generates an effective potential that behaves asymptotically as -1/2Z2e2$\alpha$/r4. Due to this effective long-range interaction, effective-range theory in its normal form is not applicable. Thus, for the scattering of a particle with an incident orbital angular momentum of zero, for example, the expansion of kcot$\eta$(0) includes terms in k and in k2lnk, in addition to the usual constant and k2 terms. The effective range r0 as normally defined is infinite, but one can define a quantity rp0 which explicitly takes into account the long-range character of the effective potential. For L>0 it is k2cot$\eta$(L) which approaches a constant as k approaches zero rather than k2L+1cot$\eta$(L) as for a short-range potential. The above results can have serious consequences in the scattering of electrons and of positrons by neutral spherically symmetric atoms. Some detailed consideration is given to the scattering by hydrogen atoms. The formulation of effective-range theory which is given is valid when Pauli exchange between the two colliding systems is possible. The method used for taking into account the effect of the Pauli principle (this method would be the same for long-range and short-range forces) is rather more convenient than in the usual presentation of effective range theory.},

@article{Wood1985,
abstract = {The structure and implementation of a new general iterative method for diagonalising large matrices (the 'residual minimisation/direct inversion in the iterative subspace' method of Bendt and Zunger) are described and contrasted with other more commonly used iterative techniques. The method requires the direct diagonalisation of only a small submatrix, does not require the storage of the large matrix and provides eigensolutions to within a prescribed precision in a rapidly convergent iterative procedure. Numerical results for two rather different matrices (a real 50*50 non-diagonally dominant matrix and a complex Hermitian 181*181 matrix corresponding to the pseudopotential band structure of a semiconductor in a plane wave basis set) are used to compare the new method with the competing methods. the new method converges quickly and should be the most efficient for very large matrices in terms both of computation time and central storage requirements; it is quite insensitive to the properties of the matrices used. This technique makes possible efficient solution of a variety of quantum mechanical matrix problems where large basis set expansions are required.},

abstract = {The importance of the excited states of Positronium (Ps) in the formation cross sections (both differential and total) of the negative hydrogen ion (H-) are investigated theoretically for the charge transfer reaction, Ps (n = 1, 2) + H ↦ e+ + H- for a wide range of incident energies (e.g., threshold – 500 eV). The calculations are performed in the frame work of a qualitative model, the post collisional Coulomb modified eikonal approximation (CMEA). A comparative study is also made between the capture from ground and excited states of the Ps. The present CMEA model takes account of higher order effects which is essential for a rearrangement process where the first Born type approximation (Coulomb Born for the ionic case) is not supposed to be adequate. At low incident energies, the excited states of Ps (2s, 2p) are found to play a dominant role in the H- formation cross sections. Significant deviations are noted between the present CMEA and the Coulomb Born (CBA) results even at very high incident energies (e.g., Ei = 500 eV), indicating the importance of higher order effects. At high incident energies the present CMEA differential cross section (DCS) exhibits a double peak structure which is totally absent in the CBA and could again be attributed to higher order effects.},

The authors have already reported the dramatic effect the inclusion of Hylleraas-type functions has on the calculated value of Zeff, the effective number of electrons per molecule available to the positron for annihilation. As far as they are aware, this is the first time that Hylleraas-type functions have been used in a molecular scattering calculation.},

abstract = {The Kohn variational method for calculating scattering parameters is formulated in an abstract vector space in terms of the extremization of a quadratic form whose coefficients represent matrix elements of H-E. This manifestly possesses certain symmetry and invariance properties not apparent in the usual formulation. Under certain conditions the method provides a bound for the exact answer if the number of variational parameters, N, is large enough. The extraneous singularities in the variationally determined value of tan$\delta$ noticed by Schwartz are analyzed. These are a direct consequence of the Kohn method and the particular normalization employed. It is shown that the pole strength (residue) of each such singularity is the product of two terms, each of which is small; these factors may be expected to decrease with increasing N.},

An upper bound of the absolute value of the phase is also shown to be obtained if the iteration method is carried out to the second approximation. Numerical examples are given in the case of a square-well potential, and very accurate upper and lower bounds of the phases are obtained.},

abstract = {The theory of angular momentum and of spherical tensor operators leads to algebraic expressions which are usually written in terms of generalized Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and/or Wigner n-j symbols. In principle, the evaluation and simplification of such expressions is a straightforward task but it can also become extremely cumbersome in more complex applications, for instance, in atomic and nuclear structure theory or in the study of angular dependent properties. In these fields, simplification techniques are either based on graphical methods or on the explicit knowledge of special values and sum rules which can be found in some standard form in the literature. The direct application of these rules, however, is often laborious due to a large number of symmetric forms of the Wigner and related symbols and due to the complexity of the expressions in Racah algebra. In order to facilitate the evaluation of Racah algebra expressions, a set of Maple procedures is presented for interactive work. In this paper, I first define proper data structures to deal with Racah algebra. These structures are the basis to provide procedures for various numerical computations. The use of recursion formulas and simplifications of typical expressions due to special values is also supported here. The impact of this interactive tool on atomic many-body perturbation theory is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Projectile-elastic, target-elastic, and full close-coupling approximation models have been employed to investigate scattering of ortho-positronium off Li and Na atoms at low energies. Nine different basis sets for each system have been used to find the relative importance of atomic (target and projectile) states on the elastic scattering parameters and the convergence of the predicted results with added eigen- and pseudostates. The s-wave elastic phase shifts, scattering lengths and cross sections of both the systems are reported upto the incident energy k=0.5 a.u. and compared with the corresponding existing theoretical predictions. It has been found that the van der Waals and higher order long-range interactions play a crucial role in predicting s-wave elastic parameters for Ps–alkali-metal-atom systems at low energies.},

We have calculated good approximations to the exact phase shifts from the square-integrable wave functions produced by the stabilization method. We have derived a simple model to explain the behavior of the eigenvalues as a function of the size of the basis. The degree of stability of the eigenvalues approximating the resonance energy is proportional to the width of the resonance.

In what is known as the Hylleraas method, a set of Slater-type orbitals for the electrons of an atom is augmented by linear (or in some cases higher powers) of the interelectron separation(s). An alternative approach, of particular value when all the particles have comparable masses, is to use a wavefunction containing exponentials in all the interparticle distances. This “exponential ansatz” is straightforward to implement when there are three particles but has only recently been implemented for four-body systems. Integral evaluation is reviewed for both the exponential ansatz and the Hylleraas method, the treatment of general angular symmetry is discussed, and kinetic-energy matrix elements are examined and related to simpler integrals. Some illustrative results for the positronium molecule (e+e−e+e−) are included.},

It has been shown that the representation of the wave function far from a molecule as a plane wave and single spherical wave emitted by the molecular center cannot be corrected. Because of the multicenter character of the problem, the asymptotic form of the wave function according to the Huygens-Fresnel principle must contain N spherical waves with centers at the nuclei of the N atoms that form the molecule. A method of partial waves for a spherically non-symmetrical target is considered for the simplest multicenter target formed by two non-overlapping potentials. The results are compared with those obtained within the single spherical wave approximation. It has been shown that the use of this approximation is intrinsically conflicting, which is a direct consequence of refusal from the Huygens-Fresnel picture of the wave scattering process.},

@article{Drake1992,
abstract = {The results of an extended series of high-precision variational calculations for all states of helium up to n=10 and L=7 (excluding S states above n=2) are presented. Convergence of the nonrelativistic eigenvalues ranges from five parts in 1015 for the 2P states to four parts in 1019 for the 10K states. Relativistic and quantum electrodynamic corrections of order $\alpha$2, $\alpha$3, $\alpha$2$\mu$/M, $\alpha$2($\mu$/M)2, and $\alpha$3$\mu$/M are included and the required matrix elements listed for each state. For the 1s2p 3PJ states, the lowest-order spin-dependent matrix elements of the Breit interaction are determined to an accuracy of three parts in 109, which, together with higher-order corrections, would be sufficient to allow an improved measurement of the fine-structure constant. Methods of asymptotic analysis are extended to provide improved precision for the relativistic and relativistic-recoil corrections. A comparison with the variational results for the high-angular-momentum states shows that the ‘‘standard-atomic-theory’’ and ‘‘long-range-interaction’’ pictures discussed by Hessels et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 2765 (1990)] come into agreement, thereby resolving what appeared to be a discrepancy. The comparison shows that the asymptotic expansions for the total energies are accurate to better than ±100 Hz for L>7, and results are presented for the 9L, 10L, and 10M states (i.e., angular momentum L=8 and 9). Significant discrepancies with experiment persist for transitions among the n=10 states, which cannot be easily accommodated by supposed higher-order corrections or additional terms. Finally, the asymptotic analysis indicates that a revision to the quantum-defect method is required for the analysis of high-precision data.},

@article{Crannell1976,
abstract = {The slowing down and annihilation of positrons and the formation of positronium in a solar flare plasma are investigated to determine how the width of the 0.511-MeV line and its strength relative to the three-photon continuum from positronium decay depend on the temperature and density of the medium in which the positron comes to rest. The calculations are limited to the cases of annihilation in a completely ionized plasma, in a partially ionized plasma with an electron/neutron density ratio of 1.0 or 0.1, and in an atomic gas with a very small ion density. Thermally averaged rate coefficients are obtained for the free annihilation of positrons and for positronium formation through radiative recombination in the fully ionized plasma. Positronium formation rates and the resultant energy distributions of the positronium atoms in the partially ionized medium are determined by numerically solving the Fokker-Planck equation in a medium where the ambient free electrons have a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of finite temperature but the density of the medium is sufficiently low that positronium atoms decay without further collisions following their formation. A Monte Carlo calculation is performed for the positron energy loss, positronium formation through charge exchange, and positronium breakup in the weakly ionized medium. The energy distributions of decaying positronium atoms and the relative number of triplet to singlet positronium decays are evaluated for ion concentrations and densities characteristic of the solar photosphere.},

The method of complex-coordinate rotation is applied together with highly correlated wave functions containing all six interparticle distances. Using such Hylleraas bases up to 6412 terms, the energy positions up to the 8S state and the widths up to the 7S state in the Rydberg series converging to the H− threshold are determined. The energies of 4S to 7S states from the present calculations are fitted into the quantum defect formula, from which the energies of higher members in the Rydberg series can be deduced.},

In contrast to the findings of a recent analysis of the experimental results for positronium formation, that the p-wave contribution is dominant, the present results show that the d-wave contribution is the largest throughout most of the Ore gap. Nevertheless, the total positronium formation cross sections, calculated from the sum of the variational s-, p- and d-wave contributions and the results of the Born approximation for all higher partial waves, display a very similar energy dependence to that of the experimental results, but are approximately 30\% smaller.},

The demonstration required the derivation of an identity connecting dilogarithm functions which is either new or not widely known. It is then shown how to modify the more general of these formulas (that of Fromm and Hill) to eliminate the necessity of branch tracking in the complex plane and thereby to achieve a straightforwardly computable formalism. By obtaining a formal cancellation of the individual-term singularities in the Fromm-Hill formula, problems of numerical instability are also avoided. The work is validated with a computer program and sample calculations.},

abstract = {We have applied many-body theory methods to study the interaction of low-energy positrons with noble-gas atoms. The positron - atom correlation potential includes explicitly the contribution from the target polarization by the positron and that from the virtual positronium (Ps) formation. It is demonstrated that the correlations and Ps formation (or tunnelling of electrons from the atom to the positron) create virtual levels in the positron - atom system. The existence of the virtual levels strongly influences the scattering and increases the positron annihilation rate by up to 400 times. The calculated elastic cross sections are in good agreement with experimental data. The inclusion of virtual Ps formation greatly improves the agreement with experimental annihilation rates with respect to calculations taking only the polarization into account. Our calculations have highlighted the difference between the calculation of positron - atom scattering and the calculation of corresponding annihilation rates. The annihilation rate is very sensitive to the behaviour of the wavefunction at small positron - electron separations. A simple approximate formula based on the Sommerfeld factor is suggested to account for the effect of electron - positron Coulomb attraction on the annihilation rates.},

abstract = {Recent research has shown that there are a number of atoms and atomic ions that can bind a positron. The number of atoms known to be capable of binding a positron has expanded enormously in recent years, with Li, He(3Se), Be, Na, Mg, Ca, Cu, Zn, Sr, Ag and Cd all capable of binding a positron. The structure of these systems is largely determined by the competition between the positron and the nucleus to bind the loosely bound valence electrons. Some systems, such as e+Li and e+Na, can be best described as a Ps cluster orbiting a charged Li+ or Na+ core, while others such as e+Be consist of a positron orbiting a polarized Be atom. In addition, a number of atoms (Li, C, O, F, Na, Cl, K, Cl, Cu, Br) can bind positronium and a few systems capable of binding two positrons have also been identified. These positron-binding systems decay by electron-positron annihilation with the annihilation rate for e+A systems largely determined by the parent atom ionization potential.},

Precise one-electron model potentials are developed to represent the motion of the valence electron in the field of the closed alkali-metal positive-ion core. The numerical results for the static multipole polarizabilities for the alkali-metal atoms and the coefficients C6, C8, and C10 for homonuclear and heteronuclear alkali-metal diatoms are compared with other calculations.},

It was seen that extrapolation of the energy to the variational limit is dependent on the basis dimension at which the exponent in the Laguerre basis was optimized. In effect, it may be best to choose a nonoptimal exponent if one wishes to extrapolate to the variational limit. An investigation of the natural orbital asymptotics revealed the energy converged as $\Delta$EN ≈ A/N6 + B/N7 + \ldots, while the electron–electron $\delta$-function expectation converged as $\Delta$$\delta$N ≈ A/N4 + B/N5 + \ldots. The asymptotics of expectation values other than the energy showed fluctuations that depended on whether N was even or odd.},

It is shown that the method is a particular case of other Kohn variational procedures which have the limitation that they give results that are dependent on the asymptotic form chosen for the wavefunction. In particular it is shown that when using S-matrix boundary conditions the calculated S-matrix need not be unitary. However, if the trial functions are adapted according to the prescription previously given by Rudge (1973-80), then the calculated S-matrix is unitary and coincides with the S-matrix calculated by any of the other Kohn methods using these same basis functions.

abstract = {We have investigated the elastic scattering of positronium atoms by hydrogen atoms below the excitation threshold at 5.1 eV, limiting the investigation to the spin-zero (singlet) state of the two electrons. Nonresonant S-wave phase shifts have been obtained from normalizable trial functions by extracting the center-of-mass wave function and examining its spatial behavior. An effective-range expansion is fitted to the phase shifts and the previously obtained positronium-hydride bound-state energy to yield a scattering length a≅5.3a0 compared with Fraser's corrected exchange result, a=7.28a0 (a0 is the Bohr radius). The stabilization method suggests that a resonance occurs at a scattering energy of 4.5 eV, about 0.6 eV below the excitation threshold. Using the complex rotation method, we have obtained evidence confirming the existence of the resonance and an estimate of its width of about 6 × 10-2 eV.},

abstract = {A pseudopotential for positronium-atom interaction, based on electron-atom and positron-atom phase shifts, is constructed, and the phase shifts for Ps-Kr and Ps-Ar scattering are calculated. This approach allows us to extend the Ps-atom cross sections, obtained previously in the impulse approximation [I. I. Fabrikant and G. F. Gribakin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 243201 (2014)], to energies below the Ps ionization threshold. Although experimental data are not available in this low-energy region, our results describe well the tendency of the measured cross sections to drop with decreasing velocity at v<1 a.u. Our results show that the effect of the Ps-atom van der Waals interaction is weak compared to the polarization interaction in electron-atom and positron-atom scattering. As a result, the Ps scattering length for both Ar and Kr is positive, and the Ramsauer-Townsend minimum is not observed for Ps scattering from these targets. This makes Ps scattering quite different from electron scattering in the low-energy region, in contrast to the intermediate energy range from the Ps ionization threshold up to v∼2 a.u., where the two are similar.},

The phase shifts were computed using the Harris variational method, while at zero energy the scattering lengths were obtained by the Kohn variational method. For hydrogen, a generalized Hylleraas wave function with three nonlinear parameters was used, giving an upper-bound scattering length a≤-2.10278, agreeing with Schwartz's result a≤-2.10. An extrapolation procedure gives an estimate of a=-2.1036±0.0004. At nonzero energies, agreement with the lower-bound results of Bhatia, Temkin, Drachman and Eiserike, to better than 0.004 rad is achieved. Since the exact atomic-helium wave function is not known, the situation for helium is less clear; various model-target wave functions are examined using a generalized Hylleraas function with two nonlinear parameters. For the exponential model used by Drachman, the scattering is in close agreement with previous results, but the annihilation-rate parameter Zeff is higher by 15\% in poorer agreement with experiment at zero energy.},

abstract = {A general expression for the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian for n-electron atoms with the fixed nucleus approximation is derived in a straightforward manner using the chain rule. The kinetic energy part is transformed into the mutually independent distance coordinates ri, rij, and the polar angles $\theta$i, and $\phi$i. This form of the Hamiltonian is very appropriate for calculating integrals using Slater orbitals, not only of states of S symmetry, but also of states with higher angular momentum, as P states. As a first step in a study of the Hylleraas method for five-electron systems, variational calculations on the 2P ground state of boron atom are performed without any interelectronic distance. The orbital exponents are optimized. The single-term reference wave function leads to an energy of −24.498369 atomic units (a.u.) with a virial factor of $\eta$ = 2.0000000009, which coincides with the Hartree–Fock energy −24.498369 a.u. A 150-term wave function expansion leads to an energy of −24.541246 a.u., with a factor of $\eta$ = 1.9999999912, which represents 28\% of the correlation energy. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{Rosenberg1975a,
abstract = {The scattering length A characterizes the zero-energy scattering of one system by another. It was shown some time ago that a variational upper bound on A could be obtained using methods, of the Rayleigh-Ritz type, which are commonly employed to obtain upper bounds on energy eigenvalues. Here we formulate a method for obtaining a variational lower bound on A. Once again the essential idea is to express the scattering length as a variational estimate plus an error term and then to reduce the problem of bounding the error term to one involving bounds on energy eigenvalues. In particular, the variational lower bound on A is rigorously established provided a certain modified Hamiltonian can be shown to have no discrete states lying below the level of the continuum threshold. It is unfortunately true that necessary conditions for the existence of bound states are not available for multiparticle systems in general. However, in the case of positron-atom scattering the adiabatic approximation can be introduced as an (essentially) solvable comparison problem to rigorously establish the nonexistence of bound states of the modified Hamiltonian. It has recently been shown how the validity of the variational upper bound on A can be maintained when the target ground-state wave function is imprecisely known. Similar methods can be used to maintain the variational lower bound on A. Since the bound is variational, the error in the calculated scattering length will be of second order in the error in the wave function. The use of the adiabatic approximation in the present context places no limitation in principle on the accuracy achievable.},

We demonstrate that singularities do exist for these variational principles by considering single and multichannel model problems based on exponential interaction potentials. The singularities are found by considering simultaneous variations in two nonlinear parameters in the variational calculation (e.g., the energy and the cutoff function for the irregular continuum functions). The singularities are found when the cutoff function for the irregular continuum functions extends over a range of the radial coordinate where the square-integrable basis set does not have sufficient flexibility. Effects of these singularities generally should not appear in applications of the complex Kohn method where a fixed variational basis set is considered and only the energy is varied.},

The momentum distributions of Ps in Ne, H2, CH4, N2, C2H4, n-C4H10, i-C5H12 and neopentane are measured as functions of mean lifetime, by using the one-dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation method. The average energies obtained for o-Ps with mean lifetimes of 3–90 ns are analysed, to yield the momentum-transfer cross sections for the Ps–gas molecule scattering. The cross sections thus determined are $\sigma$m = (20 ± 8) × 10−16 cm2 for Ne, (16 ± 3) × 10−16 cm2 for H2, (17 ± 6) × 10−16 cm2 for CH4, (37 ± 10) × 10−16 cm2 for N2, (35 ± 8) × 10−16 cm2 for C2H4, (100 ± 30) × 10−16 cm2 for n-C4H10, (110 ± 50) × 10−16 cm2 for i-C5H12 and (180 ± 60) × 10−16 cm2 for neopentane, in the Ps energy range below 0.3 eV.

The higher (\$n\backslash ge 3\$) excitations and ionization of the Ps atom are calculated using the first Born approximation. Calculations are reported of scattering lengths, phase shifts, elastic, Ps- and H-excitation, and total cross sections. Remarkable correlations are observed between the S-wave Ps-H binding energy and the singlet scattering length, effective range, and resonance energy obtained in various model calculations. These correlations suggest that if a Ps-H dynamical model yields the correct result for one of these four observables, it is expected to lead to the correct result for the other three. The present model, which is constructed so as to reproduce the Ps-H resonance at 4.01 eV, automatically yields a Ps-H bound state at -1.05 eV which compares well with the accurate value of -1.067 eV. The model leads to a singlet scattering length of 3.72\$a\_0\$ and effective range of 1.67\$a\_0\$, whereas the correlations suggest the precise values of \$3.50a\_0\$ and 1.65\$a\_0\$ for these observables, respectively.},

abstract = {Antimatter was first predicted1 in 1931, by Dirac. Work with high-energy antiparticles is now commonplace, and anti-electrons are used regularly in the medical technique of positron emission tomography scanning. Antihydrogen, the bound state of an antiproton and a positron, has been produced2, 3 at low energies at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) since 2002. Antihydrogen is of interest for use in a precision test of nature’s fundamental symmetries. The charge conjugation/parity/time reversal (CPT) theorem, a crucial part of the foundation of the standard model of elementary particles and interactions, demands that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same spectrum. Given the current experimental precision of measurements on the hydrogen atom (about two parts in 1014 for the frequency of the 1s-to-2s transition4), subjecting antihydrogen to rigorous spectroscopic examination would constitute a compelling, model-independent test of CPT. Antihydrogen could also be used to study the gravitational behaviour of antimatter5. However, so far experiments have produced antihydrogen that is not confined, precluding detailed study of its structure. Here we demonstrate trapping of antihydrogen atoms. From the interaction of about 107 antiprotons and 7 × 108 positrons, we observed 38 annihilation events consistent with the controlled release of trapped antihydrogen from our magnetic trap; the measured background is 1.4 ± 1.4 events. This result opens the door to precision measurements on anti-atoms, which can soon be subjected to the same techniques as developed for hydrogen.},

@article{Gerjuoy1983,
abstract = {The use of variational principles as a calculational tool is reviewed, with special emphasis on methods for constructing such principles. In particular, it is shown that for a very wide class of problems it is possible to construct a variational principle (VP) for just about any given quantity Q of interest, by routine procedures which do not require the exercise of ingenuity; the resultant VP will yield an estimate of Q correct to second order whenever the quantities appearing in the VP are known to first order. The only significant requirement for application of the routine procedures is that the entities which enter into the definition of Q be uniquely specified by a given set of equations; the equations may involve difference or differential or integral operators, they may be homogeneous or inhomogeneous, linear or nonlinear, self-adjoint or not, and they may or may not represent time-reversible systems. No numerical calculations are presented, but procedures for the construction of VP's are illustrated for numerous quantities Q of physical interest, particularly those Q arising in quantum-mechanical scattering and transition probability calculations. For pedagogical purposes VP's are also derived for several problems in classical and (simple) mathematical physics which the authors hope will prove instructive and perhaps even amusing. The quantum-mechanical quantities Q whose VP's are examined include various matrix elements and the quantum-mechanical eigenfunctions themselves. Topics examined include some points which have not always been appreciated in the literature, such as the necessity for properly specifying the phase when complex eigenfunctions are involved, and the importance of avoiding, wherever possible, formulations requiring the inversion of singular operators. The basic element of the technique is the recognition that the defining equations of a system can be incorporated into the VP as constraints through the use of (generalized) Lagrange multipliers; these can be constants, scalar, vector, or tensor functions of one or more variables, operators, etc. In the typical problem, these Lagrange multipliers L serve as a new set of adjoint functions or entities, and the construction of the VP simultaneously provides well-defined equations for the L. Moreover, these L often have ready physical significance themselves; for example, they often may be regarded as generalized Green's functions. The construction of the VP also readily yields so-called variational identities for the quantity Q of interest; these identities give explicit (if formal) expressions for the error in the variational estimate of Q. In some cases this error can be shown to have a definite sign, so that the VP actually is an extremum principle, that is, that it yields an upper or lower variational bound for Q; however, our routine procedures for constructing VP's do not routinely yield extremum principles.},

By employing a generalized Hylleraas-type wave function that includes all six interparticle coordinates, a very accurate value of the resonance position Er is obtained, along with a good value of the width. The present result for Er(-1.205±0.001 Ry) is lower than the previous result of Drachman and Houston, who omitted the interelectronic coordinate r12 in their trial function. In addition, the lowest ground-state energy of positronium hydride is obtained by using 210 terms in the trial wave function. The effect of the r12 coordinate and others on both the resonant energy and the binding energy of PsH is discussed.},

The earliest of such methods dates back to work of Jacobi in the middle of the 19th century. Since computing eigenvalues and vectors is essentially more complicated than solving linear systems, it is not surprising that highly significant developments in this area started with the introduction of electronic computers around 1950. In the early decades of this century, however, important theoretical developments had been made from which computational techniques could grow. Research in this area of numerical linear algebra is very active, since there is a heavy demand for solving complicated problems associated with stability and perturbation analysis for practical applications. For standard problems, powerful tools are available, but there still remain many open problems. It is the intention of this contribution to sketch the main developments of this century, especially as they relate to one another, and to give an impression of the state of the art at the turn of our century.},

abstract = {Calculations of total cross sections for Ps(1 s) scattering by atomic hydrogen, helium, and argon are reported for the energy range 0–150 eV. The results for atomic hydrogen have been evaluated exactly within the first Born approximation. For collisions with helium and argon in which the target remains in its initial state (so called target elastic collisions) it is assumed that the positronium scatters off a frozen target atom and a coupled positronium pseudostate approximation is then used to calculate the cross sections. For collisions in which the target atom is excited or ionized (target inelastic collisions) the first Born approximation is adopted. Here there is a significant problem in summing over all final states of the target and for this a scheme due to Hartley and Walters has been employed. It is found that for the light targets, hydrogen and helium, target inelastic collisions become dominant above 45 and 105 eV, respectively, while for the heavier argon atom, target elastic scattering is always more important. Except at the lowest energies, and for both target elastic and target inelastic collisions, positronium ionization is the main outcome of the collision for all three atoms. There is an encouraging degree of agreement at the higher energies with the total cross-section measurements of Zafar et al. and Laricchia et al. for helium and argon. The present approximations do not include electron exchange between the positronium and the atom which may be the main source of disagreement between theory and experiment elsewhere.},

Our treatment is sufficiently general to be applied directly to arbitrary potential scattering or single open channel scattering problems, with exchange if required. In the course of our analysis, we develop a framework formally to describe the anomalous behaviour of our generalized Kohn calculations in the regions of the well-known Schwartz singularities. This framework also explains the mathematical origin of the anomaly-free singularities we reported in a previous article. Moreover, we demonstrate a novelty: that explicit solutions of the Kohn equations are not required in order to calculate optimal phase shift approximations. We relate our rigorous framework to earlier descriptions of the Kohn-type methods.},

For the first time in Ps collisions, a resonantlike structure is observed. For the present target, it occurs around 9.5 eV followed by a broader peak at ∼60 eV. Following Brawley et al. [Science 330, 789 (2010)] who have observed similarities between the total cross sections of positronium and of electrons incident upon a given target at the same velocity, a corresponding comparison is made for CO2. The comparison suggests that the former peak corresponds to the well-known 2$\Pi$u shape resonance which occurs for electrons at an incident velocity of 0.5 a.u. Further features are discussed and theoretical input is sought.},

@article{Bethe1949,
abstract = {The scattering of neutrons up to about 10 or 20 Mev by protons can be described by two parameters, the scattering length at zero energy, a, and the effective range, r0. A formula (16), expressing the phase shift in terms of a and r0 is derived; it is identical with one previously derived by Schwinger but the derivation is very much simpler. Reasons are given why the deviations from the simple formula are very small, as shown by the explicit calculations by Blatt and Jackson. The theory is then applied to proton-proton scattering, with a similarly simple result. Moreover, a method is developed to compare proton-proton and proton-neutron scattering without explicit calculation of a nuclear potential. The most recent experimental results are evaluated on the basis of the theory, and accurate values for the effective ranges are obtained for the triplet scattering of neutrons, and for proton-proton scattering. The nuclear force between two protons is found to differ by a slight amount, but beyond doubt, from that between neutron and proton in the singlet state. All actual results agree with those obtained by Breit and collaborators, and by Blatt and Jackson.},

abstract = {At long distances, interactions between neutral ground-state atoms can be described by the van der Waals potential. In the ultracold regime, atom-atom scattering is dominated by s-waves phase shifts given by an effective range expansion in terms of the scattering length $\alpha$0 and the effective range r0. We show that while the scattering length cannot be predicted for these potentials, the effective range is given by the universal low-energy theorem r0=A+B/$\alpha$0+C/$\alpha$02, where A, B, and C depend on the dispersion coefficients Cn and the reduced diatom mass. We confront this formula to about 100 determinations of r0 and $\alpha$0 and show why the result is dominated by the leading dispersion coefficient C6. Universality and scaling extend much beyond naive dimensional analysis estimates.},

Our results are sensitive to small changes in the accuracy of the wavefunction representing the target hydrogen molecule. We have developed a systematic approach to demonstrate that, at low positron energies, there are particular forms of the Kohn trial wavefunction for which the results of variational calculations are not reliable, even when the target wavefunction accounts for as much as 96.8\% of the correlation energy of H2. We find that reliable results can be recovered if our calculations are extended to admit more sophisticated target wavefunctions accounting for 99.7\% of the correlation energy. Remaining discrepancies between theory and experiment are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Software debugging, maintenance and reuse have to deal with many problems from Fortran scientific codes that do not fully respect the standard specification. Our study on Linpack, PerfectClub and SPEC95 benchmarks and several industrial software reveals a large number of unprecise variable declarations that prevent program analysis, verification and parallelization. Furthermore, they decrease the readability of programs and make reverse-engineering more difficult.This paper presents two different methods to compute the exact size of arrays in Fortran codes that have pointer-type $\backslash$verb+REAL A(1)+ or assumed-size $\backslash$verb+REAL A(*)+ declarations.The first method uses the relationship between actual and formal arguments from parameter-passing rules. New array declarations in the called procedure are computed with respect to the declarations in the calling procedures.The second approach is based on an array region analysis that gives information about the set of array elements accessed during the execution of code. This approach to array resizing could be applied to other languages without array declaration such as MATLAB and APL in order to reduce the execution overhead of dynamic test and resizing.Our two approaches are combined to yield very good results for Linpack, PerfectClub and SPEC95 benchmarks.},

This way for q=1 Rosengren’s second proof of the SU(1,1) case is adapted for the SU(2) case to derive the known triple sum formula of Ali\v{s}auskas and Jucys, as well as six new independent triple sum formulas for the Wigner 9j coefficients of the angular momentum theory. The mutual rearrangement possibilities of the derived triple sum formulas by means of the Chu–Vandermonde summation formulas are considered and applied to derive several versions of double sum formulas for the stretched q-9j coefficients, which give new rearrangement and summation formulas of special Kamp\'{e} de F\'{e}riet functions and their q-generalizations.},

@article{Lebeda1969,
abstract = {A variational wave function for the ground state of positronium hydride is presented. The wave function is considerably more accurate than any previously reported. The only simplifications used are (a) only kinetic and Coulombic potential energy terms are included in the Hamiltonian, (b) the motion of the proton is ignored, and (c) the nucleus-positron distance is excluded from the wave function. The last assumption is the major source of error, but it enables us to evaluate all integrals exactly. Several trial wave functions are examined, the one giving the lowest energy being an open-shell exponential function times a 12-term power series through second-degree terms in the five remaining interparticle coordinates. Positronium hydride is found to be stable with respect to separation into hydrogen and positronium by at least 0.657 eV. The annihilation rate for two-photon events is found to be 2.095 nsec-1 for the trial wave function giving the lowest energy, and 2.265 nsec-1 for the trial wave function which most nearly satisfies the positron-electron cusp condition. A search for bound excited states of PsH and a bound state for the system e+He was unsuccessful.},

@article{Drachman1979,
abstract = {The "molecule" positronium hydride (PsH), consisting of one atom each of positronium and hydrogen, has one well-known particle-stable state of total energy E=-1.575 Ry. In addition, for each L it must have an infinite Rydberg series of excited states whose principal configuration is (e+H-), converging to a limit at E=-1.0555 Ry, the energy of H-. All of these excited states are energetically able to dissociate into ground-state Ps + H, and the higher-lying states can also decay with emission of excited Ps and ground-state H. These Rydberg states should appear as resonances in Ps + H scattering. In this paper I compute the lowest S-wave resonance parameters, using an optical-potential formalism based on the (e+H-) configuration. The results are in rough agreement with those previously obtained using Kohn variational or complex-rotation techniques with highly correlated trial functions. The physical description of the PsH excited states is thus clarified.},

abstract = {An investigation of several alternative representations of modified effective-range theory (MERT) has been carried out for low-energy electron scattering from the rare gases argon, neon and krypton in an effort to determine the energy range over which they can be applied to the analysis of scattering cross sections. One purpose of the MERT analysis is to provide a bridge from a total cross section to a momentum transfer cross section in order to compare the results of beam experiments with those of electron swarm experiments. Simulations using published (theoretical) phaseshifts indicate that extended versions of the standard effective-range theory with five adjustable parameters are required to give an adequate description of the phaseshifts for argon. A five-parameter MERT fit gives a good representation of a recent e--Ar total cross section experiment at energies less than 1.0 eV. The resulting momentum transfer cross section is in agreement with a momentum transfer cross section obtained from a swarm experiment at energies below 0.3 eV, but at energies greater than 0.5 eV there are differences of up to 20\%. The application of MERT to neon and krypton total cross section data has also been investigated. The derivation of momentum transfer cross sections (via MERT) for both these atoms involves much larger uncertainties than was the case for argon.},

abstract = {We have continued our investigation into the elastic scattering of positronium atoms by hydrogen atoms, extending the work to include the spin-one (triplet) state of the two electrons. Once again we have extracted the S-wave phase shifts from normalizable trial functions by examining the spatial behavior of the center-of-mass wave functions. An effective-range expansion linear in the positronium energy fits the results very well and leads to a scattering length a(-)≃2.36a0, compared with the static result a(-)=2.476a0 of Hara and Fraser. The S-wave total and ortho-para conversion cross sections are calculated by making use of both 1S and 3S results. In the 3S case, we see no indication of any resonances below the excitation threshold at 5.1 eV.},

abstract = {This article presents a combined experimental and theoretical overview of positronium collisions with atoms and molecules. It starts with a de- scription of the basic properties of positronium. This is followed by a survey of experimental methods. These include positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS and SSPALS), angular correlation of annihilation radiation (ACAR), Doppler broadening (DB), positronium beam experiments, and many-positron techniques. Theoretical developments are next described, including the Born approximation, coupled-state methods, variational techniques, stabilization methods, model poten- tials, Monte Carlo methods, the impulse approximation, and resonances. There then follows a critical comparison between experiment and theory on low-energy momen- tum transfer cross-sections, total cross-sections, integral and differential ionization cross-sections, and positronium-positronium scattering. Comparison is also made with equivelocity free electron and positron scattering, highlighting the remarkable result that positronium scattering tends to follow that of a bare electron. The article concludes with a look towards future directions.},

abstract = {In analogy to Laplace's expansion, an arbitrary power rn of the distance r between two points (r 1, ϑ1, $\phi$1) and (r 2, ϑ2, $\phi$2) is expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials of cos ϑ12. The coefficients are homogeneous functions of r 1 and r 2 of degree n satisfying simple differential equations; they are solved in terms of Gauss' hypergeometric functions of the variable (r </r >)2. The transformation theory of hypergeometric functions is applied to describe the nature of the singularities as r 1 tends to r 2 and of the analytic continuation of the functions past these singularities. Expressions symmetric in r 1 and r 2 are obtained by quadratic transformations; for n = −1 and n = −2; one of these has previously been given by Fontana. Some three‐term recurrence relations between the radial functions are established, and the expressions for the logarithm and the inverse square of the distance are discussed in detail. For arbitrary analytic functionsf(r), three analogous expansions are derived; the radial dependence involves spherical Bessel functions of (r <∂/∂r >) of of related operators acting on f(r >), f(r 1 + r 2) or f[(r 1 2 + r 2 2)½].},

@article{Schiff1965a,
abstract = {A method is outlined for calculating nonrelativistic eigenvalues and wave functions for a two-electron P state of odd parity, and for evaluating the mass polarization and all of the relativistic corrections, apart from the radiative terms. Calculations have been made for the low-lying P states of He and the 21P state of Li+ using up to 560 terms in expansion of the wave function. The nonrelativistic eigenvalues converge to within an accuracy of from 10-4 cm-1 to 10-2 cm-1. The values of the mass polarization and of the relativistic corrections converge more rapidly than this, so that the total theoretical ionization energy is estimated to be correct to within an error of not more than 10-2 cm-1, i.e., considerably less than the experimental error, in the case of all of the states considered. The difference between the theoretical and experimental term values is in no case greater than 0.1 cm-1 in absolute magnitude, and is presumed to be due to the contributions from the radiative terms, which have not been included in the calculation. The term value obtained for the 21P state of Li+ confirms the identification of the line at 9581.42 \AA in the Li+ spectrum as belonging to the 21S-21P transition.},

abstract = {We have performed a three-body calculation for investigation of S-wave resonances in the positron–helium scattering in the hyperspherical coordinates. B-splines are used to obtain accurate hyperspherical potential curves and channel functions. An adiabatical hyperspherical approach is used to predict semi-quantitatively the position of the resonances. A multichannel calculation with the stabilization method is also used to extract accurately the positions and widths of resonances. We find four resonances associated with the He+–Ps(n = 2) channel. The resonance parameters for the lowest two resonances are in reasonable agreement with the calculations of Kar and Ho (2004 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 37 3177), and two more new resonances below the Ps(n = 2) threshold are identified.},

Such a facility is useful, for example, to permit the experimental identification of definite integrals based on their numerical values. The performance and accuracy of these three quadrature schemes are compared using a suite of 15 integrals, ranging from continuous, well-behaved functions on finite intervals to functions with infinite derivatives and blow-up singularities at endpoints, as well as several integrals on an infinite interval. In results using 412-digit arithmetic, we achieve at least 400-digit accuracy, using two of the programs, for all problems except one highly oscillatory function on an infinite interval. Similar results were obtained using 1012-digit arithmetic.},

abstract = {The Hylleraas-type variational method is used to calculate the energies of the lithium 1s22s2S and 1s22p2P isoelectronic sequences up to Z=20. The oscillator strengths for the 1s22s2S⃗1s22p2P transitions are evaluated for Z up to 20, including finite nuclear mass effects, and the corresponding lifetimes are determined. The 1/Z expansion method is used to extend the variational results to larger values of Z. Relativistic corrections to the dipole transition moment squared are estimated by comparison with the relativistic many-body perturbation theory results of Johnson et al. [At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 64, 279 (1996)]. The final lifetime for the 1s22p2P state of lithium is in good agreement with recent high-precision measurements.},

@article{Levy1963a,
abstract = {Phase shifts can be used to describe the quantum mechanical scattering of a particle by a spherically symmetric potential. They are odd functions of the wave number k, which is proportional to the square root of the energy of the incident particle. For short‐range potentials, they are analytic at k = 0 and can be expanded in odd powers of k. However for long‐range potentials they are not analytic at k = 0 so they cannot be expanded in powers of k. Since electron‐atom, atom‐atom, proton‐neutron, and multipole‐multipole potentials are of long range, it is important to consider such potentials. A method is presented for determining the appropriate expansions around k = 0. The method is applied to potentials which are O(r−v) as r → ∞, and the phase shifts for any angular momentum are obtained up to and including the first nonanalytic term. For L = 0 and 3 < v < 4 the next term is also obtained. The nonanalytic terms involve ln k and fractional powers of k. The results for v = 4 and the k dependence for v = 2L + 3 agree with those obtained in a different way by O'Malley, Spruch, and Rosenberg. The method involves a function $\eta$(r) whose asymptotic value $\eta$(∞) is the desired phase shift. A nonlinear first‐order ordinary differential equation is derived for $\eta$(r). This equation is solved by expansion and iteration methods. To expand the solution around k = 0, two simple theorems are proved concerning the asymptotic forms of certain integrals containing a parameter.},

abstract = {Modified effective-range formulas recently developed for electron-atom scattering are employed first to analyze the Ramsauer-Kollath (RK) electron-rare gas atom cross sections, and then to compare them with determinations of the same quantities made by different and newer methods. It is found that these cross sections can be extrapolated unambiguously down to zero energy. The extrapolated RK scattering lengths are found to be approximately 1.19, 0.24, -1.70, -3.7, and -6.5a0 for He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively. Good agreement is found, in general, both in sign and magnitude with the pressure shift estimates of the scattering lengths. Momentum transfer cross sections are also extended down to zero energy and are compared with some drift velocity and microwave results. The best agreement is found with the Gilardini and Brown curve for Ne, and with those of Pack, Phelps, Frost, and Voshall for the other rare gases, although there are some differences with the latter. In particular, a "pressure effect" is discussed in connection with these results.},

@article{Kato1951a,
abstract = {A general method is developed for a rigorous estimation to upper and lower bounds of scattering phases in the variational methods applied to one-dimensional problems. It is also possible to estimate the mean error of the approximate wave function itself. An essential point in the method is the evaluation of mean square $\epsilon$2 of of the left-hand side of the wave equation with respect to a weight function chosen appropriately. Also we have need of certain auxiliary constants $\alpha$, $\beta$ defined in connection with an eigenvalue problem associated with the wave equation. However, only a rough estimate is required of these quantities, and some general methods are gien for their estimation. As an example, the scattering of slow electrons by hydrogen atoms is treated in the one-body approximation. It turns out that phases are determined rigorously with the possible errors of 10-3 or 10-4 by assuming a very simple trial function containing only two parameters, and that the approximate wave function is also exact within about 10-2.},

abstract = {The new complete orthonormal sets of -Laguerre type polynomials (-LTP,) are suggested. Using Schr$\backslash$"odinger equation for complete orthonormal sets of -exponential type orbitals (-ETO) introduced by the author, it is shown that the origin of these polynomials is the centrally symmetric potential which contains the core attraction potential and the quantum frictional potential of the field produced by the particle itself. The quantum frictional forces are the analog of radiation damping or frictional forces suggested by Lorentz in classical electrodynamics. The new -LTP are complete without the inclusion of the continuum states of hydrogen like atoms. It is shown that the nonstandard and standard conventions of -LTP and their weight functions are the same. As an application, the sets of infinite expansion formulas in terms of -LTP and L-Generalized Laguerre polynomials (L-GLP) for atomic nuclear attraction integrals of Slater type orbitals (STO) and Coulomb-Yukawa like correlated interaction potentials (CIP) with integer and noninteger indices are obtained. The arrange and rearranged power series of a general power function are also investigated. The convergence of these series is tested by calculating concrete cases for arbitrary values of parameters of orbitals and power function.},

A second approach allows all integrals with the aforementioned indices to be evaluated by the use of Sack’s expansion [J. Math. Phys. 5, 245 (1964)] of the interelectronic separation, which leads to a reduction of the above nine-dimensional integrals to a set of three-dimensional integrals. A discussion is given for the numerical evaluation of the three-dimensional integrals that arise.},

@article{Levy1963,
abstract = {Phase shifts can be used to describe the quantum mechanical scattering of a particle by a spherically symmetric potential. They are odd functions of the wave number k, which is proportional to the square root of the energy of the incident particle. For short-range potentials, they are analytic at k = 0 and can be expanded in odd powers of k. However for long-range potentials they are not analytic at k = 0 so they cannot be expanded in powers of k. Since electron-atom, atom-atom, proton-neutron, and multipole-multipole potentials are of long range, it is important to consider such potentials. A method is presented for determining the appropriate expansions around k = 0. The method is applied to potentials which are O(r−v) as r → ∞, and the phase shifts for any angular momentum are obtained up to and including the first nonanalytic term. For L = 0 and 3 < v < 4 the next term is also obtained. The nonanalytic terms involve ln k and fractional powers of k. The results for v = 4 and the k dependence for v = 2L + 3 agree with those obtained in a different way by O'Malley, Spruch, and Rosenberg. The method involves a function $\eta$(r) whose asymptotic value $\eta$(∞) is the desired phase shift. A nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equation is derived for $\eta$(r). This equation is solved by expansion and iteration methods. To expand the solution around k = 0, two simple theorems are proved concerning the asymptotic forms of certain integrals containing a parameter.},

@article{Blatt1949,
abstract = {Variational methods developed by Schwinger are applied to neutron-proton scattering at energies below 10 Mev. S-wave scattering alone is considered, and the tensor force is not taken into account. An expansion is obtained for the phase shift in powers of the energy. The coefficients can be evaluated explicity from the wave function. The first term of the series is related to Fermi's scattering length, the second term involves an "effective range." The third and higher terms turn out to be negligible. The results are used to define an "intrinsic range" for a potential well of arbitrary shape. Thus a reasonable comparison of potential wells of different shapes is made possible. The relation between intrinsic range and effective range is discussed. The experimental data on coherent and incoherent neutron-proton scattering are discussed in terms of a "shape-independent" approximation. The best value for the effective range in the triplet state is rt=(1.56±0.13)×10-13 cm. The effective range in the singlet state is not well determined by the present data. The effect of higher, shape-dependent terms in the expansion of the phase shift is considered. These terms become more important as the well shape becomes more long tailed, but they are found to be negligible within experimental uncertainties for the four well-shapes considered here (square, Gaussian, exponential, and Yukawa). The results for the scattering phase shifts can be extrapolated to negative energy to give an approximate algebraic equation for the energy of the bound state of the deuteron. All the numerical results are shown in graphical form; interpolation formulas are provided where higher accuracy may be needed.},

The data for the pellets and the aerogel in vacuum show that the slowing down of parapositronium (p-Ps) in the free space between the silica grains depends on the number of collisions and hence on the mean distance between the grains. The momentum distribution of orthopositronium (o-Ps) shows further slowing down because of its long lifetime. From the ACAR data obtained from specimens of aerogel filled with gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, H2, CH4, CO2, and iso-C4H10), the momentum-transfer cross sections between Ps and the gas molecules are estimated. It is concluded that the Ps kinetic energy is transferred only to the translational motion of the gas molecules, i.e., the excitations of vibration and rotation of the molecules are negligible.},

In this paper we present the ongoing efforts to achieve the parallelization of octopus. We focus on the real-time variant of TDDFT, where the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations are directly propagated in time. This approach has great potential for execution in massively parallel systems such as modern supercomputers with thousands of processors and graphics processing units (GPUs). For harvesting the potential of conventional supercomputers, the main strategy is a multi-level parallelization scheme that combines the inherent scalability of real-time TDDFT with a real-space grid domain-partitioning approach. A scalable Poisson solver is critical for the efficiency of this scheme. For GPUs, we show how using blocks of Kohn-Sham states provides the required level of data parallelism and that this strategy is also applicable for code optimization on standard processors. Our results show that real-time TDDFT, as implemented in octopus, can be the method of choice for studying the excited states of large molecular systems in modern parallel architectures.},

Very elaborate trial functions were used and it is believed that the results have converged to within 10\% of their exact values. These results have been combined with others by the present authors for s- and p-wave scattering in an investigation of the behaviour of the total elastic scattering cross section in the vicinity of the positronium formation threshold and, also, of the angular distribution of the positronium. The findings of both investigations suggest a possible explanation of the discrepancy between the experimental measurements of the positronium formation cross section by Charlton et al. (1983) and Fornari et al. (1983).},

abstract = {We have carried out an analysis of singularities in Kohn variational calculations for low-energy (e+–H2) elastic scattering. Provided that a sufficiently accurate trial wavefunction is used, we argue that our implementation of the Kohn variational principle necessarily gives rise to singularities which are not spurious. We propose two approaches for optimizing a free parameter of the trial wavefunction in order to avoid anomalous behavior in scattering phase shift calculations, the first of which is based on the existence of such singularities. The second approach is a more conventional optimization of the generalized Kohn method. Close agreement is observed between the results of the two optimization schemes; further, they give results which are seen to be effectively equivalent to those obtained with the complex Kohn method. The advantage of the first optimization scheme is that it does not require an explicit solution of the Kohn equations to be found. We give examples of anomalies which cannot be avoided using either optimization scheme but show that it is possible to avoid these anomalies by considering variations in the nonlinear parameters of the trial function.},

abstract = {A method is outlined for calculating nonrelativistic eigenvalues and wave functions for a two-electron P state of odd parity, and for evaluating the mass polarization and all of the relativistic corrections, apart from the radiative terms. Calculations have been made for the low-lying P states of He and the 21P state of Li+ using up to 560 terms in expansion of the wave function. The nonrelativistic eigenvalues converge to within an accuracy of from 10-4 cm-1 to 10-2 cm-1. The values of the mass polarization and of the relativistic corrections converge more rapidly than this, so that the total theoretical ionization energy is estimated to be correct to within an error of not more than 10-2 cm-1, i.e., considerably less than the experimental error, in the case of all of the states considered. The difference between the theoretical and experimental term values is in no case greater than 0.1 cm-1 in absolute magnitude, and is presumed to be due to the contributions from the radiative terms, which have not been included in the calculation. The term value obtained for the 21P state of Li+ confirms the identification of the line at 9581.42 \AA in the Li+ spectrum as belonging to the 21S-21P transition.},

While a lot is known about the binding energies, not much is known about the radii of the atoms and ions and bond lengths and structures of these exotic entities. This article brings for the first time exact values of these structural properties which are comparable with known data. It is hoped that the results will be of help for a better understanding and further development of the chemistry and physics of these exotic compounds and of their possible role as intermediates in chemical and interfacial processes.},

Using such Hylleraas-type bases up to 6412 terms, the energy positions for the 1S–8S states in the Rydberg series converging to the Ps− threshold, as well as the four widths for the 2S–5S states, are calculated. The energies for the 5S–8S states of this Rydberg series are then used to fit into the quantum defect formula, from which the energy levels for higher members of the Rydberg series can be estimated.},

The results for Ps- Li+ and Ps-Ps scattering represent the first published scattering lengths for these systems. The positive scattering length for completely spin-aligned 3Ps-3Ps scattering, namely 2.95a0, is particularly significant since it demonstrates the feasibility of forming a stable Bose-Einstein condensate of 3Ps atoms.},

abstract = {When ortho-positronium collides with a hydrogen atom not only may it be scattered, but there is also the possibility of conversion of the ortho-positronium to para-positronium by electron exchange. The total elastic cross section and the conversion cross section have been calculated for positronium kinetic energies 0 to 9.8 ev, for the l=0 partial wave only. A particular choice of trial wave function explicitly satisfying the Pauli principle and a variational argument lead to integro-differential equations, with no `ordinary force', from which the phase shifts have been obtained by a numerical method. The cross sections are very strongly energy dependent: the total cross section ranges from 192$\pi$a02 at zero energy to 2.92$\pi$a02 at 6.8 ev, while the (conversion)/(total) ratio ranges from 0.176 to 0.070 over these energies. These ratios are well below the value ¼ expected at high energies from the Born approximation. The total cross section results of Massey and Mohr for this problem using Born approximation were 230$\pi$a02 at zero energy and 25$\pi$a02 at 6.8 ev, with the (conversion)/(total) ratio ¼.},

abstract = {An anti-Gaussian quadrature formula is an (n+1)-point formula of degree 2n-1 which integrates polynomials of degree up to 2n+1 with an error equal in magnitude but of opposite sign to that of the -point Gaussian formula. Its intended application is to estimate the error incurred in Gaussian integration by halving the difference between the results obtained from the two formulas. We show that an anti-Gaussian formula has positive weights, and that its nodes are in the integration interval and are interlaced by those of the corresponding Gaussian formula. Similar results for Gaussian formulas with respect to a positive weight are given, except that for some weight functions, at most two of the nodes may be outside the integration interval. The anti-Gaussian formula has only interior nodes in many cases when the Kronrod extension does not, and is as easy to compute as the (n+1)-point Gaussian formula.},

abstract = {The multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) in combination with the frame transformation (FT) approach is applied to model the Fano-Feshbach resonances measured for \$\^{}\{7\}\$Li\$\^{}\{87\}\$Rb and \$\^{}\{6\}\$Li\$\^{}\{87\}\$Rb [Marzok \{$\backslash$it et al.\} Phys. Rev. A \{$\backslash$bf 79\} 012717 (2009)]. The MQDT results show a level of accuracy comparable to that of previous models based on direct, fully numerical solutions of the the coupled channel Schr$\backslash$"odinger equations (CC). Here, energy levels deduced from 2-photon photoassociation spectra for \$\^{}\{7\}\$Li\$\^{}\{85\}\$Rb are assigned by applying the MQDT approach, obtaining the bound state energies for the coupled channel problem. Our results confirm that MQDT yields a compact description of photoassociation observables as well as the Fano-Feshbach resonance positions and widths.},

The data was analyzed using both a top-of-barrier model and a modified effective range theory. Both approaches explicitly take into account the significant polarization potential in the final continuum channels. The study involving both experiment and theory enabled us to investigate the effect of the polarization on near-threshold photodetachment. Furthermore, since photodetachment and electron scattering are related in the half-collision concept, we were able to determine low-energy electron scattering quantities such as phase shifts, elastic cross sections, and s wave scattering lengths for electron scattering on excited Li and K atoms. The results allowed us to predict a virtual state in the e−(ks)-Li(3p) system.},

abstract = {A detailed investigation has been made of low energy s-wave positron-lithium scattering using the Kohn variational method in the energy range in which only elastic scattering and positronium formation are possible (0-1.84 eV). The positronium formation cross section is infinite at zero energy, but then falls to be several orders of magnitude smaller than the elastic scattering cross section, which has a peak value of approximately 100 pi a02. The elastic scattering cross sections are almost unaffected by the uncoupling of the positronium channel, but the resulting phaseshifts are significantly more positive, and therefore probably more accurate, than those obtained in the most sophisticated previous study using the uncoupled approximation.},

Unlike in the \$s\$ wave case, the semiclassical solution does not provide unique value of the constants.

Oscillator strengths, radiative rates and line strengths are reported for all E1, E2, M1 and M2 transitions among the lowest 98 levels of the n <= 4 configurations. Additionally, theoretical lifetimes are listed for all 98 levels. Collision strengths are averaged over a Maxwellian velocity distribution and the effective collision strengths obtained listed over a wide temperature range up to 10**7.7 K. Comparisons are made with similar data obtained from the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) to highlight the importance of resonances, included in calculations with DARC, in the determination of effective collision strengths. Discrepancies between the collision strengths from DARC and FAC, particularly for forbidden transitions, are also discussed.},

In the positron-hydrogen-molecule scattering calculations, we use the Kohn variational method to calculate Zeff, the number of target electrons available to the positron for annihilation. In the helium-antihydrogen scattering calculations, we use the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method to calculate a wave function for the leptons as a function of the distance between the helium and the antihydrogen. This is used, together with the associated nuclear wave function and the wave function for $\alpha$bar p + Ps−, to calculate the cross section for the rearrangement reaction He + bar H → $\alpha$bar p + Ps−, using the T-matrix and a form of the distorted wave approximation. For both processes, positron-electron correlation is taken into account accurately using Hylleraas-type functions.},

abstract = {A simple variation of the well-known method of minimizing a function of several variables by changing one parameter at a time is described. This variation is such that when the procedure is applied to a quadratic form, it causes conjugate directions to be chosen, so the ultimate rate of convergence is fast when the method is used to minimize a general function. A further variation completes the method, and its ensures that the convergence rate from a bad approximation to a minimum is always efficient. Practical applications of the procedure have proved to be very satisfactory, and numerical examples are given in which functions of up to twenty variables are minimized.},

abstract = {Formulas are presented for the recursive generation of four-body integrals in which the integrand consists of arbitrary integer powers (≥−1) of all the interparticle distances rij, multiplied by an exponential containing an arbitrary linear combination of all the rij. These integrals are generalizations of those encountered using Hylleraas basis functions and include all that are needed to make energy computations on the Li atom and other four-body systems with a fully exponentially correlated Slater-type basis of arbitrary quantum numbers. The only quantities needed to start the recursion are the basic four-body integral first evaluated by Fromm and Hill plus some easily evaluated three-body “boundary” integrals. The computational labor in constructing integral sets for practical computations is less than when the integrals are generated using explicit formulas obtained by differentiating the basic integral with respect to its parameters. Computations are facilitated by using a symbolic algebra program (MAPLE) to compute array index pointers and present syntactically correct FORTRAN source code as output; in this way it is possible to obtain error-free high-speed evaluations with minimal effort. The work can be checked by verifying sum rules the integrals must satisfy.},

abstract = {There are numerous applications in sciences, engineering and mathematics that give rise to problems involving the computation of orthogonal projections onto selective invariant subspaces of matrices. Conventional algorithms for subspace estimation based upon eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) or singular value decomposition (SVD) are, however, both expensive to compute, and difficult to make recursive or implement in parallel. In contrast, algorithms based on the QR factorization have established pipelinable architectures. In this paper, we introduce novel matrix-inverse free algorithms for block matrix decomposition. They involve a combination of Newton's method and the QR factorization. Some of these methods can be shown to have cubic or quadratic convergence rates, while others can be of any desirable convergent rate},

Using floating-point values as real numbers does not clearly identify the precision with which each value must be represented. Too little precision yields inaccurate results; too much wastes computational resources. The popularity of multimedia applications has made fast hardware support for low-precision floating-point arithmetic common in Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), SIMD Within A Register (SWAR) instruction set extensions for general purpose processors, and in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). In this paper, we describe a simple approach by which the speed of these low-precision operations can be speculatively employed to meet user-specified accuracy constraints. Where the native precision(s) yield insufficient accuracy, a simple technique is used to efficiently synthesize enhanced precision using pairs of native values.},

@article{Schiff1965a,
abstract = {A method is outlined for calculating nonrelativistic eigenvalues and wave functions for a two-electron P state of odd parity, and for evaluating the mass polarization and all of the relativistic corrections, apart from the radiative terms. Calculations have been made for the low-lying P states of He and the 21P state of Li+ using up to 560 terms in expansion of the wave function. The nonrelativistic eigenvalues converge to within an accuracy of from 10-4 cm-1 to 10-2 cm-1. The values of the mass polarization and of the relativistic corrections converge more rapidly than this, so that the total theoretical ionization energy is estimated to be correct to within an error of not more than 10-2 cm-1, i.e., considerably less than the experimental error, in the case of all of the states considered. The difference between the theoretical and experimental term values is in no case greater than 0.1 cm-1 in absolute magnitude, and is presumed to be due to the contributions from the radiative terms, which have not been included in the calculation. The term value obtained for the 21P state of Li+ confirms the identification of the line at 9581.42 \AA in the Li+ spectrum as belonging to the 21S-21P transition.},

Evaluation of the expectation value of the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian using explicitly correlated wave functions leads to sets of integrals that diverge individually. By appropriately combining these integrals, and using some judicious series expansions, all the integration problems are resolved in terms of well-known auxiliary functions.},

A 65, 032721 (2002)] we reexamined a model describing the structure of the low-energy Ps-H resonances as being due to quasibound states of the positron in the perturbed Coulomb potential of the H- ion appearing in the closed, rearranged channel. In particular, we wished to understand why the lowest p-state resonance was so far away from the lowest quasibound (2p) state. We found that the lowest resonance actually corresponds to the first-excited [3p] state, while the lowest state is not recognizable as a resonance. In the present work we repeat our analysis, but this time for the lowest d state. We find that the lowest [3d] state does correspond to a resonance shifted moderately.},

Our results are sensitive to small changes in the accuracy of the wavefunction representing the target hydrogen molecule. We have developed a systematic approach to demonstrate that, at low positron energies, there are particular forms of the Kohn trial wavefunction for which the results of variational calculations are not reliable, even when the target wavefunction accounts for as much as 96.8\% of the correlation energy of H2. We find that reliable results can be recovered if our calculations are extended to admit more sophisticated target wavefunctions accounting for 99.7\% of the correlation energy. Remaining discrepancies between theory and experiment are briefly discussed.},

Three variants of the Kohn variational method are used with very flexible trial wavefunctions and a very accurate helium wavefunction. The elastic scattering and positronium formation cross sections are believed to have converged to within 5\% and 10\%, respectively. The calculated positronium formation cross section displays a similar energy dependence to that of recent experimental results but with a 25\% difference in magnitude. However, the theoretical total cross section, both above and below the positronium formation threshold, agrees with the experimental measurements to within 10\%. Threshold effects in the s-wave cross sections manifest themselves as a significant feature in the total cross section. Similarities with the corresponding results for positron-hydrogen scattering are discussed.},

abstract = {By group theoretical arguments, it can be shown that a wave function, $\psi$$\mu$L, for a system of N particles corresponding to a total angular momentum quantum number, L, and a quantum number, $\mu$, referring to the z component of angular momentum may be written as a sum of terms: The DL(R)$\mu$s are the representation coefficients for the Lth irreducible representation of the three‐dimensional rotation group, and are functions of the three coordinates specifying the orientation of the system of particles in space. The $\chi$$\mu$L are functions of the 3N−6 coordinates specifying the relative configuration of the N‐particle system. The set of coupled differential equations for the functions, $\chi$$\mu$L, is obtained explicitly. The special case of the three‐particle system is discussed in detail. The present treatment is more directly usable than the previous discussions since the basic equations do not involve implicit relationships between the variables.},

In this case, we predict that there will be a single Standard Model-like Higgs boson with a calculable mass 105 GeV \$\backslash lesssim M\_h \backslash lesssim\$ 129 GeV depending on tan beta (the ratio of the Higgs vevs in the MSSM).

The processes leading to the formation and dissociation of positronium are considered as well as those which lead to the slowing down of a positronium pair in a gas and to the conversion of ortho- into para-positronium. It is shown that the rate of the latter process probably depends strongly on the kinetic energy of the pair. Elastic collisions of a pair, in its ground state, with gas atoms are determined almost completely by electron exchange interaction, but this is so strong that it cannot be taken account of in a weak coupling treatment.},

Calculations are reported of scattering lengths, phase shifts, and of elastic, Ps excitation, and total cross sections.

The momentum distribution of the positronium is observed by using the one-dimensional angular correlation of the annihilation radiation method. Silica aerogel is used to form a sufficient amount of positronium in a restricted region necessary for the high-resolution measurements. The average energies of orthopositronium for mean lifetimes ranging from 3.2 to 86 ns are determined by applying static magnetic fields. A thermalization model which includes the momentum-transfer cross section as an adjustable parameter is fitted to the average energy.

Results for scattering lengths, partial, total and differential cross-sections as well as resonance and binding energies in different systems are discussed.},

@article{El-Gogary1995,
abstract = {A variational treatment for obtaining the binding energies, wavefunctions and internal distances of the positronium molecule (Ps2) is presented. For this purpose, very modern Hylleraas-type trial wavefunctions, as well as different envelope functions ( upsilon m6e- gamma upsilon where m6=0, 1, 2, 3 and upsilon is the distance between the two positrons), are employed. The resulting binding energies show excellent convergence when the number of components of the wavefunction considered is increased. Our results at m6=2 show that only 22 components of our wavefunction are sufficient for obtaining the binding energy omega P(s2)=-0.03 Ryd (=-0.41 eV) which is identical to the binding energy calculated by Ho via 400 components of his trial wavefunctions. The best convergence, however, has been achieved via 22 components of our wavefunctions at m6=1. In this case, omega P(s2)=-0.042 Ryd (=-0.573 eV). Comparison with the very recent value of omega P(s2)(=-0.435 eV) determined by Kinghorn and Poshusta (1993) and Kozlowski and Adamowicz (1993), using 300 components of their trial wavefunctions, supports the opinion that the exact binding energy of Ps2 is less than -0.41 eV. Our average values for the internal distances of Ps2 agree quite well with those determined by previous authors and emphasize the argument that the size of the molecule is decreased when the binding energy is lowered.},

The state can be found in the 2,4So symmetries with the two electrons in a spin-triplet state. The binding energy against dissociation into the H(2p)+Ps(2p) channel was 7.03×10-4 hartree. The dominant decay mode of the states will be radiative decay into a configuration that autoionizes or undergoes positron annihilation. The NaPs system of the same symmetry is also electronically stable with a binding energy of 1.514×10-3 hartree with respect to the Na(3p)+Ps(2p) channel.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider two scattering processes: low-energy positron-hydrogen-molecule and helium-antihydrogen scattering. In the positron-hydrogen-molecule scattering calculations, we use the Kohn variational method to calculate Zeff, the number of target electrons available to the positron for annihilation. In the helium-antihydrogen scattering calculations, we use the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method to calculate a wave function for the leptons as a function of the distance between the helium and the antihydrogen. This is used, together with the associated nuclear wave function and the wave function for $\alpha$bar p + Ps−, to calculate the cross section for the rearrangement reaction He + bar H → $\alpha$bar p + Ps−, using the T-matrix and a form of the distorted wave approximation. For both processes, positron-electron correlation is taken into account accurately using Hylleraas-type functions.},

The effective three-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solved with the finite element method. Because the model potential gives rise to three spurious states, the true ground state of e+Na is embedded in a dense spectrum of spurious states. We develop a method for extracting the correct ground state for e+Na, even when the energy is nearly degenerate with a spurious level. The calculated value for the binding energy is consistent with other calculations.},
